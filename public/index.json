This is different to numeric continuous variable which modelled differently (such as blood pressure 120.2,135.9).\nCount may also have contextual information i.e with time, area or length. Question starting as “How many (events)” generally answered with counts.Such as number of road accidents in given year, number of rain drops in square meter area.\n\rDistribution/Model to consider in count data\rThe prime distribution of count is poisson. The other models are avialable to overcome two majors issues in counts : overdispersion (or less often underdispersion) and excess zeros. Or sometime zero is impossible value for the outcome ( such length of stay-no 0 length of stay), in this condition, zero truncated model is useful.\nTo overcome over or under dispersion:\n\rNegative Binomial distribution (NB)\rPoisson Inverse Gaussian (PIG)\rGeneralized Negative Binomial Model\rGeneralised Poisson\rHeterogeneous Negative Binomail model (NB-H)\r\rTo ovecome excess zero’s:\n\rzero-inflated Poisson (ZIP)\rzero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)\rHurdle model\r\rTo model outcome where 0 is impossible value\n\rzero truncated models\r\rknitr::include_graphics(\u0026#39;/images/poisson_models_types.PNG\u0026#39;)\rFigure 1 Models for count data: mean-variance relationships and its parameterisation\n\r1 Poisson distribution\r\rsingle parameter\rmean \\([\\mu]\\) is equal to variance \\([\\mu]\\), also called equidispersion\rin real life datasets, more often there will be higher variability or correlation than model allows (over-dispersion) which leads to biased standard errors ( so as misleading signficance of covarite)\r\r\r2 Negative Binomial\r\rhas additinal dispersion parameter \\([\\alpha]\\) to accomodate excess variability. when the dispersion parameter is zero,\rthe model becomes Poisson\rcan be traditional negative binomial (NB1) or quadratic negative binomial (NB2)\rOnly correct overdispersion ( not underdispersion of poisson)\rform of Poisson-gamma mixture with dispersion parameter \\([\\alpha]\\) has gamma distribution. Gamma distribution is very flexible in shape so most (not all) overdispesed count data modelled well with NB\rIt is possible that NB may not correct overdispersion in a Poisson model\r\r\r3 Poisson Inverse Gaussian (PIG)\r\rSimiller to negative binomial except the disperson parameter \\([\\alpha]\\) has inverse gaussian distribution\rAvaialbe in R gamlass package\r\r\r4 Generalized Negative Binomial Model (GNB)\r\rThe GNB parameterizes the exponent on the second term of the\rnegative binomial variance.\rTo get initial idea whether data is suited to NB1 or NB2 or NB-P\r\r\r5 Generalised Poissson Models\r\rSimiller to above models but dispersion parameter can take negative values which also correct underdispersion if present\r\r\r6 Heterogeneous Negative Binomail model (NB-H)\r\rDispersion parameter can be associated with particular covariate which bring singificant dispoersion in the model.\r\r\r7 Exact poisson regression\rfor unbalnced and sparce count data\nIn count model log of count are modelled with respect to linear predictors. This is will make sure that predicted count will always be positive.\nThe expected percentage of zero counts on the basis of the Poisson\rmodel is under 1%. If mean of count response is 5 or below and some 30% of the count observations consist of zeros,ZIP or ZINB will be good choice.\n\r\r"
