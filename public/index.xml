      <description>We first need to understand following some fundamental concepts. The idea behind bootstrapping is very closely aligned with those concepts.
Here I have created a hypothetical study in which we are interested in finding out the average birth weight of the babies born in the UK at 37 weeks of gestation.

      <description>Reshaping though frequently required in data analysis, so often it remains confusing even if you are frequent user of reshape function in R.Here I have provided more explanation with simulated data.
[1] Wide to longWide data: the observation has been made several time but all the observations for given person is recorded in single row in spreadsheet.For example, in clinic, person visiting every month for their blood pressure check, and nurse note down the value for each month in single row which belong to this specific person.</description>

      <description>What is a count ?Count is a number which is discrete and non-negative. Discrete means a number which is a countable and distinct. For example, number of road accidents. Road accidents can be 2 or 852 but can not be 2.1 or 85.5. So its discrete i.e integer. This is different to numeric continuous variable (such as blood pressure 120.2,135.9) which modelled differently.
Count may also have contextual information i.</description>
