      <description>Reshaping though frequently required in data analysis, so often it remains confusing even if you are frequent user of reshape function in R.Here I have provided more explanation with simulated data.
[1] Wide to longWide data: the observation has been made several time but all the observations for given person is recorded in single row in spreadsheet.For example, in clinic, person visiting every month for their blood pressure check, and nurse note down the value for each month in single row which belong to this specific person.</description>

      <description>Count outcome or count datacount basically is a number which is discrete and non-negative (integers such as 0,1 or 895 but not 0.6,1.9 or 895.66). It is a number(or sum) of event. This is different to numeric continuous variable which modelled differently (such as blood pressure 120.2,135.9).
Count may also have contextual information i.e with time, area or length. Question starting as “How many (events)” generally answered with counts.</description>
