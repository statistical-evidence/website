{{< button theme="danger" >}}About me{{< /button >}}

I am a [Research Associate (Statistician) at **the University of Bristol**](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/clinical-sciences/people/chetan-a-prajapati/index.html), and previously I worked as Statistician in [Centre for the Prevention of Stroke and Dementia, **University of Oxford**](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/cpsd). I hold masters in Medical Statistics from the [**University of Leicester**](https://le.ac.uk/health-sciences) where I also hold specialization in **Genetic Epidemiology**. I am also [John Henry Brookes Scholar](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/studying-at-brookes/finance/postgraduate-finance---uk-and-eu-students/sources-of-funding-for-postgraduate-uk-and-eu-students/) of [**Oxford Brookes University**](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/public-health/). 

I have extensive experience in analysing longitudinal, time to event data from epidemiological studies. As a mix of both, theoretical and applied Statistician, I thrive to explore and apply novel statistical methods to data of various types. Most recently, this has included the implementation of multivariate time series models to explore the relationship between multiple time-series. My other interests are **clinical trial design and analysis**, **survival analysis**, **mixed models and analysis of data-set with statistical complexities**(i.e. with missing data, sparse or unbalanced).  I am a proud **R** user and experienced in analysing data with **STATA**, **WinBUGS**, **StatXact**, and **MLWin**.

I am fully registered with our professional body [Royal Statistical Society (RSS) UK](https://www.rss.org.uk/) ([RSS](http://www.rss.org.uk/RSS/pro_dev/pro_awards/Graduate_statistician/Prof%20reg/Prof_Reg_G.aspx?hkey=6f3595d4-6887-46ea-8025-ebb2daae7dc2) Registration number 125676). I advice you to check if you are looking to hire a statistician online for your research project.
